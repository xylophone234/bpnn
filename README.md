# bpnn
bpnn back propagation neural network  by python numpy

## strage problems
1. sigmoid function is very strage. I use it as active function, It only convergence  on single point trainset. In hole
trainset the gradient is rapidly to zero. I don't know why.

2. if I use tanh instead of sigmoid ,it works well.
